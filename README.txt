An application developed by Biss Kanungo, Mandeep Singh, and Bill Zhou for CIS 039 in May 2018. This application is demo for a student portal and 2/4 year pathway for community college or university students. Note that this is not a final version and can be further expanded. What is seen here was the small demo we created for our class final.
